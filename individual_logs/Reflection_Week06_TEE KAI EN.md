1. Which quality criterion do you think will be hardest to achieve? 
The hardest criterion to achieve will be the Accuracy Target for the YOLOv8 model. Specifically, detecting small, high-variance items like student IDs or individual keys is technically challenging due to different lighting conditions and backgrounds on campus. Ensuring the model maintains a high mean Average Precision (mAP) without significant "false positives" will require extensive data labeling and testing.

2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why? 
The Resource Risk (R2)—specifically insufficient GPU credits or cloud compute budget—poses the greatest threat. Since the project relies heavily on training a deep learning model, running out of compute resources would completely halt our ability to improve the model's accuracy. Unlike schedule delays which can be mitigated by extra work hours, a lack of technical resources creates a hard stop for an AI project.

3. How does quality management support project success? 
Quality management ensures that the deliverables meet the agreed-upon standards of the university stakeholders. By using Quality Checklists and defining clear Metrics, we ensure the system is not just "finished," but actually functional and reliable for students. This prevents project failure caused by a system that technically exists but fails to accurately identify lost items in real-world scenarios.
