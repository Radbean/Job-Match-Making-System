# Reflection – Week 03

### 1. What was the most challenging part of building the schedule?
The most challenging part this week was identifying realistic task durations and defining clear dependencies between activities.
At first, some tasks such as model development and frontend design seemed to overlap, but after reviewing the workflow, 
I learned how to sequence them logically. Setting dependencies helped me visualize the full timeline and 
understand how delays in early tasks can affect the overall project delivery.

### 2. How did GitHub and MS Teams support collaboration?
GitHub allowed our team to maintain a single version of all project documents and track updates efficiently. 
Each member could push changes and review commits, which reduced confusion about file versions. 
MS Teams provided real-time communication and file sharing; we used it to discuss timeline adjustments
and confirm milestones. Posting our plan screenshot in Teams also made feedback from our supervisor faster and easier.


### 3. What tasks will you refine next week?
Next week, I plan to refine the detailed technical requirements and start mapping datasets for the AI components
(CV parsing, NLP, and job matching models). I also aim to improve the Gantt chart by adjusting durations after 
getting feedback from the supervisor. As a team, we’ll review risk management and decide how to monitor progress 
weekly using the GitHub issues board.
