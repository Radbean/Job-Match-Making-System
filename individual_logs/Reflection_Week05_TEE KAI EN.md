1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why? The development and UI phase has the highest cost. Building the interface for students to report lost items requires more specialized human hours compared to automated tasks like training a model.

2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality? We could use open-source datasets (like COCO) for base training to reduce the hours spent on manual data gathering and labeling. Additionally, using "Free Tier" cloud services for the database (like Firebase) would eliminate initial software costs.

3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success? Resource allocation dictates the speed of the project. If we only allocate one person to labeling data, the "Train Model" task is delayed. Proper allocation ensures that high-priority tasks (like the AI detection engine) have the necessary hardware and time to succeed early in the timeline.

4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I will focus on Project Quality Management and Risk Identification to ensure our AI model meets accuracy standards and to prepare mitigation plans for potential technical or resource-related threats.
