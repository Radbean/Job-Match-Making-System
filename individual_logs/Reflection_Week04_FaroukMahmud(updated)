Project Reflection – Week 4
1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, my primary contribution was decomposing our "Job MatchMaking System" roadmap into a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). I focused on defining the project's major phases and, most critically, breaking down the complex AI Model Design & Training phase into specific, actionable subtasks. This included detailing steps for the CV Parsing module, predictive model training, and the recommendation engine's core logic.

2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned the immense value of detailed task decomposition for team alignment and project manageability. Transforming the abstract goal of an "AI Recommendation Engine" into concrete, manageable tasks made the project scope clear for everyone. This process facilitated more precise discussions on resource allocation and technical dependencies, turning a high-level plan into an executable blueprint.

3. What challenges did I face?
The main challenge was accurately estimating the time and complexity for high-uncertainty technical tasks. Setting realistic deadlines for achieving the >90% accuracy target in CV parsing was difficult, as it involves unpredictable steps like data cleaning and hyperparameter tuning. This required deep consultation with the team to advocate for and allocate adequate time buffers. A secondary, minor challenge was ensuring the technical documentation (like the WBS table in GitHub) was correctly formatted and clear for all team members.

4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I will focus on initiating the Requirements & Data phase. My primary goals are to:

Finalize the Detailed Requirements Document based on team feedback.

Begin the critical task of gathering and acquiring raw IT job market data.
This data acquisition step is the project's foundation, as the quality and completeness of our dataset will directly determine the success of all subsequent model development and evaluation.
