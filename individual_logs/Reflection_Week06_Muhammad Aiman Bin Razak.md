# Individual Reflection - Week 06 - [Your Name]

## Reflection Questions

1.  **Which quality criterion do you think will be hardest to achieve?**
    Getting the matching algorithm to be 85% accurate will probably be our toughest challenge. It's hard to teach a system what makes a "good match" between a person and a job—it's not just about keywords, but about understanding experience levels, skill relevance, and even context. This is much more subjective than just measuring if text was read correctly.

2.  **Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?**
    Without a doubt, **bad data** (R1) is our biggest threat. You can build the most beautiful dashboard and the cleanest code, but if the AI is trained on messy or incomplete resumes, it will give bad matches. It's like building a house on a weak foundation—everything might look good until it collapses.

3.  **How does quality management support project success?**
    Quality management keeps us honest. It's easy to say "the system works," but our quality checklist makes us prove it. Are matches actually accurate? Does the interface actually make sense? By setting clear standards and checking them along the way, we make sure we're building something that actually helps people find jobs, not just another piece of software.
