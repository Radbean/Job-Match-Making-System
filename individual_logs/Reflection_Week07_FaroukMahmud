1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, I performed a deep-dive into our project's timeline using Critical Path Analysis (CPA). I identified that our "Job MatchMaking System" has an initial duration of 55 days, with the critical path running through Requirements, Data Cleaning, NLP Training, and the Recommendation Algorithm (A → B → D → E → G → H → I). I also conducted a Schedule Crashing Analysis, where I successfully reduced our project timeline to 51 days by allocating an additional RM500 for extra GPU hours and a temporary frontend developer. I documented these calculations in the Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) table and updated our GitHub repository under /schedule/.

2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned that "Time is Money" is a literal trade-off in project management. Identifying the Critical Path taught me that not all tasks are created equal; while Activity C (CV Parsing) has 2 days of "slack," any delay in Activity E (Recommendation Algorithm) would immediately push back our final submission. Collaboratively, this helps us prioritize resources. I also learned that Crashing a project involves more than just adding money—it requires balancing team morale and quality. Rushing the frontend (Activity G) saves time but increases the risk of bugs, which we must now monitor closely.

3. What challenges did I face?
The most significant challenge was the mathematical complexity of the Forward and Backward pass calculations. Ensuring that the Early Start (ES) and Late Start (LS) aligned to find "zero slack" activities required several rounds of verification. Additionally, choosing which activities to crash was difficult. We identified Activity E (Recommendation Algorithm) as our highest scheduling risk because AI model training is unpredictable. Deciding to spend RM200 specifically on "Extra GPU hours" was a calculated risk to ensure that unpredictable training times don't bottle-neck the entire 51-day schedule.
