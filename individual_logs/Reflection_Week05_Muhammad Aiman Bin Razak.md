# Week 05 Reflection – Cost Management

## 1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?
-Looking at our budget, it's clear that the Frontend and Dashboard Development stage is where most of our money is going. The main reason is that building a user-friendly interface and making sure it talks smoothly to the backend and AI models is just really time-consuming. It requires a lot of back-and-forth work from several of us to get it right, and all those hours really add up.

## 2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?
-Use open-source tools instead of paid licenses.

-Optimize cloud resources with spot instances.

-Reuse existing code components.

-Implement peer reviews to prevent rework.

## 3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?
Good resource matching ensures tasks are done efficiently by the right people, preventing delays and budget overruns. It helps spot bottlenecks early and keeps the project on track for success.
