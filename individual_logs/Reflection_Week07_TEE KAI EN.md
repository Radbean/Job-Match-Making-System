1. How does effective communication reduce project risks? 
It ensures that technical issues (like model detection failures) are reported early, allowing for resource reallocation before the deadline.

2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?
Campus Security is most critical because they are the functional owners; if the system does not meet their operational needs, the AI solution will not be adopted.

4. What will I focus on next week? 
I will focus on Monitoring, Control, and Performance Tracking to evaluate how our actual execution aligns with the project baseline.
