# Reflection - Week 09
## Time Management & Critical Path Analysis

**Name:** [Your Name]

## 1. Why is identifying the critical path important?

- Shows which tasks control project completion time
- Helps prioritize resources and monitoring
- Enables better schedule management
- Basis for making crashing decisions

## 2. Which activity posed the highest scheduling risk?

**Activity G (Frontend Development - 25 days)**  
**Why:** Longest duration on critical path, any delay directly extends project.

**Activity D (Backend Development - 25 days)**  
**Why:** Also long duration and on critical path, technical complexity.

## 3. What trade-offs are involved in crashing?

- **Cost vs Time:** Faster = more expensive
- **Quality vs Speed:** Rush may reduce quality
- **Resources:** Need more people or overtime
- **Risk:** More errors possible
- **Team:** Increased pressure on team
