1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, I contributed by designing the project workflow diagram and developing an executable project plan. I also searched for available datasets online to prepare for the upcoming stages of data processing and model development.

2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned the importance of clear communication when working with teammates. Through discussion, we reached a middle ground on our project direction and clarified our responsibilities. I also realized how sharing knowledge from other courses can help the team plan more effectively and identify potential improvements in our system.

3. What challenges did I face?
One challenge I faced was explaining my ideas in a way that my teammates could easily understand. I had to simplify technical terms and provide detailed explanations so everyone could visualize the project plan clearly and assess whether the ideas were executable.

4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I will focus on data searching, data preparation, and collaborative planning with my teammates to begin the development process. My goal is to ensure the dataset we select is clean, relevant, and suitable for the projectâ€™s objectives.
