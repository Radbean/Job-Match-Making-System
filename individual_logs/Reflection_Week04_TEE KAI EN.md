1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, my main contribution was in decomposing our "Job MatchMaking System" schedule into a detailed Work Breakdown Structure. I focused on defining the major phases, particularly breaking down the complex AI Model Design & Training  phase into specific subtasks like implementing the CV Parsing module and training the predictive model.

2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned the immense value of detailed decomposition through the WBS process. Breaking down the abstract goal of an "AI Recommendation Engine" into concrete, manageable tasks made the entire project feel less overwhelming and more actionable.

3. What challenges did I face?
The challenge i faced was accurately estimating the time and complexity for the AI Model Design & Training tasks. For instance, setting realistic deadlines for tasks involving high technical uncertainty, such as achieving the >90% accuracy target for CV parsing using OCR and NLP, proved difficult. This required deep consultation with the team to allocate adequate time buffers for data cleaning and model hyperparameter tuning, which are often unpredictable. Another minor challenge was ensuring the markdown table formatting was correct when documenting the WBS in GitHub.

4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I will focus entirely on initiating the first major phase Requirements & Data. Specifically, my goal is to finalize the Detailed Requirements Document and begin the crucial task of gathering and acquiring the raw IT job market data needed for our models. This data acquisition step is critical because all subsequent model training and evaluation depend directly on its quality and completeness.
