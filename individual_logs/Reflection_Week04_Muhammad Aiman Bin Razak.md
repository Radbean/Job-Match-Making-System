#Reflection – Week 04

1. Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
   
-The Frontend & Dashboard Development phase had the most subtasks. It involved creating the user interface, building the web components, and linking everything with the backend and AI models. This part required a lot of teamwork to make sure the dashboard looked good and worked smoothly.

2. How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
   
-Breaking the project into smaller tasks made everything easier to understand and manage. It helped us see which tasks depend on each other, assign work more clearly, and set more realistic deadlines. It also improved our teamwork because everyone knew what to focus on.

3. What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
   
-Next week, we’ll review the timeline for the AI Model Development since training and testing might take more time. We also plan to add some buffer time before testing to handle any possible bugs or integration issues.
