# Lessons Learned - Week 08
## Individual Reflection

**Name:** MUHAMMAD AIMAN BIN RAZAK

## 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?

The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with clear ownership** helped most. Each task had:
- Specific owner
- Clear deadlines
- Measurable deliverables

This made tracking easy and identified delays quickly.

## 2. What would you do differently in future projects?

- **Add buffer time** for AI tasks (unpredictable)
- **Better resource balance** - don't overload one person
- **More frequent technical check-ins** (twice weekly)
- **Backup plans** for technical challenges
- **Earlier risk mitigation** for data and model issues
