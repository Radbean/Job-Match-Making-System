# Project Scope Document
Job MatchMaking System

## Objectives
This project aims to develop an intelligent AI-powered platform that efficiently connects IT job seekers with employers. Key objectives include:
*To automate the CV parsing and skill extraction process with over 90% accuracy.
*To develop a robust AI matching algorithm that suggests the top 3 most suitable job roles for a candidate with over 80% precision.
*To build a user-friendly web dashboard for both job seekers and employers to view matches, insights, and analytics.
*To reduce the average hiring cycle time by streamlining the initial screening and matching process.


## Deliverables
The tangible outputs of this project will be:
-A functional web application (Frontend & Backend)
-Trained Machine Learning Models (OCR, NLP, Recommendation Engine)
-A project report and final presentation
-A complete dataset of processed CVs and job listings (anonymized)
-System documentation and user manuals

\# Project Concept Statement



Title: Job Match-Making System



\## Problem Statement



Recruitment processes are often time-consuming and inefficient, particularly when managing large volumes of applications. Human recruiters invest significant effort in manually screening resumes, which increases the risk of bias, human error, and processing delays. At the same time, job seekers face difficulties in identifying roles that accurately align with their skills and experience amid numerous job postings. Therefore, there is a growing need for an intelligent, automated system capable of performing efficient CV screening and personalized job matching to optimize the hiring process for both employers and applicants.



\## Objectives



* To automatically extract and analyze CV information (skills, experience, education, certifications) using NLP.  
* To intelligently match candidates with job openings based on company requirements and similarity ranking.  
* To recommend suitable jobs to job seekers based on their profiles and preferences.  
* To reduce recruitment time and improve accuracy in candidate selection through intelligent automation.  
* To create an interactive dashboard for both recruiters and applicants. 



\## Proposed Approach



The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) for resume parsing and Machine Learning (ML) for job–candidate matching.

* **Resume Parsing:** Utilize tools such as SpaCy, NLTK, or BERT to extract structured data from unstructured text.
* **Matching Algorithm:** Implement similarity scoring or machine learning models (e.g., cosine similarity, TF-IDF, or neural embeddings) to evaluate candidate–job fit.
* **Recommendation Engine:** Generate ranked job suggestions for users based on their profiles and preferences.
* **User Interface:** Develop a web-based dashboard using React (frontend) and Flask/Django (backend).
* **Database:** Store job postings and parsed resumes using MySQL or MongoDB.



\## Expected Outcome



A functional prototype that can:  

* Automatically rank candidates for a given job posting.  
* Recommend best-fit jobs for job seekers.  
* Reduce manual screening time and bias in recruitment.  
* Provide a clean and user-friendly dashboard for both employers and job seekers.  



\## Evaluation Metrics



* **\*Matching Accuracy:\*** Precision and recall of candidates–job matching results.
* **\*Recommendation Effectiveness:\*** Percentage of successful matches or accepted job offers.  
* **\*Processing Efficiency:\*** Time taken to process and rank resumes.  
* **\*User Satisfaction:\*** Feedback scores from recruiters and applicants.
