## Integration Notes

- The **AI Model Development** and **Frontend Development** phases have the highest cost due to intensive resource hours.
- Costs are aligned with project milestones for example model training coincides with the mid-project high-cost phase.
- High-cost tasks are scheduled in periods with minimal overlapping high-effort tasks to balance resource usage.
